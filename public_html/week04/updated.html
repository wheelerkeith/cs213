	<p>This is a change from last week because there was nothing to show phone number or address or hours at the top of the page last week.
	   With this added it is easier for someone to find that information, and I will be able to add a menu to this area of the page.</p>

	<h1>Added a services tab</h1>
	<a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html">Webstyle Page</a>
	<p>The services page gives the visitor a list of services offered by my company in a seperate page so that the main page can be smaller.
	   It provides a logical break from the main page to keep clutter down.</p>
